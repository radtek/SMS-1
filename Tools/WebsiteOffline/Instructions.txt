In order to use the WebsiteOffline tool it is required to setup the target environment in a specific way:

1. Copy the 'Offline' directory next to the SMS website directory. 
2. Make sure that the SMS website in IIS is called 'Default'.
3. Create new IIS website called 'Offline' with the :443 on https and with the same certificate as the 'Default' website.
4. Point that to the 'Offline' directory.
5. Copy 'PS' directory and PutWebsiteUnderMaintanance.bat and SwitchWebsiteOn.bat files to X:\Tools for easy access.

To have Under Maintanance page run PutWebsiteUnderMaintanance.bat as an Administrator.
