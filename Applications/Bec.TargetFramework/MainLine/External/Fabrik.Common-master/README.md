# Fabrik.Common

## Overview

Fabrik.Common is full of useful code that we use every day at [fabrik](http://www.getfabrik.com). It's so useful that we decided to release it as open source.

We're still gathering and testing much of the code from applications we've authored so please stay tuned for more updates and documentation.

## Development Workflow

`master` branch only holds the latest stable version of the project. Navigate to the `dev` branch to view the latest activity.

## Pull Requests & Branching

Features should be developed in their own branch, branched off of the `dev` branch.

Pull Requests should be targeted to the `dev` branch, not master! Before sending the pull request, make sure you have the latest dev branch merged into your feature branch.
